// src/components/ShopGrid/ShopGrid.jsx
//
// The shops a customer can order from, as one row of cards sliding past under
// the hero copy, the full width of the hero. It answers one question - "can
// you get me something from my shop?" - and leaves what happens next to the
// steps further down.
//
// The row travels leftwards, so a new shop enters from the right and reads
// the way the text above it does. It is a loop rather than a carousel with
// controls - there is nothing to choose between, so a control would be a
// decision nobody wants to make.
//
// The shops are rendered twice. The animation slides exactly half the track,
// so the moment the first copy has left the second is sitting where it began
// and the seam never shows. Only the first appearance of each shop is
// announced and reachable by tab; every repeat - the second copy, and any
// fill for a short list - is hidden from assistive technology and taken out
// of the tab order. Hearing or tabbing through the same shops twice would be
// a bug, not a feature.
//
// The shops come from the API the office edits in the dashboard, through
// useShops - so adding a shop there adds it here, with no code change. Until
// that request answers, and if it fails, the bundled list in
// src/data/shops.js stands in. The copy is under `home.shops`.

// would slide off and leave a gap before it came round again.
//
// This is only the starting point. Once the row is on screen it measures the
// real window and the real cards and adds more if they are needed - browser
