"""Raising a notification, and getting the e-mail on its way.

Called from the two places a customer-visible event actually happens:
Invoice.mark_sent() and PackageViewSet.perform_update(). Functions rather than
post_save signals, for the reasons invoicing/services.py sets out at length —
Package.save() runs for plenty of reasons that are not news, and a signal would
have to guess which ones were.

Every function here follows the same shape: write the row inside the caller's
transaction, then queue the e-mail with transaction.on_commit so the worker
cannot read a notification that has not landed yet.

    an invoice send as a 500 when it plainly succeeded. The notification row is
