"""Intake sheets in Django's own admin.

The dashboard is where these are written; this is for the cases the dashboard
deliberately will not do - reading a sheet whose reference somebody has
forgotten, or looking at `emailed_at` to see whether a handover mail ever
actually left.

Released sheets are read-only here too. The rule that a handover is evidence
rather than a form does not stop applying because the URL changed.
