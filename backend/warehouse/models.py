"""The warehouse intake sheet, as a record rather than a sheet of paper.

This is the form somebody fills in on the floor when goods arrive: was it
collected or dropped off, is it packed properly, is there damage, how many
colli, how big, by sea or by air. On paper it is a clipboard that then has to
find its way to the people who book the shipment in - and a clipboard on the
wrong desk is a shipment nobody is working on.

So a sheet here has two lives, and `status` is the line between them:

* A **draft** belongs to the warehouse. It is half-filled, it is wrong in
  places, and it is nobody else's business yet. Any staff account may edit it.
* A **released** sheet is a handover. The moment it is released the rest of
  the staff are mailed a copy and can start the process, so from then on the
  sheet is evidence of what was handed over and stops being editable - see
  `release()` below, which is the only way across that line.

Not a one-way door, though. `reopen()` puts a released sheet back into draft
so a mistake can be corrected, and bumps `revision` so that the next release
tells everybody which version they are looking at. The lock is there to stop
a handover being edited under the people acting on it, not to pretend nobody
ever writes down the wrong number.

Nothing here is visible to a customer. There is no customer-facing serializer
and no route outside /api/staff/, which is deliberate: the sheet holds what
staff wrote about a delivery - damage, bad packing, a name off the van - and
that is an internal record, not a shipment update.
